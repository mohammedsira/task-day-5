== In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are objects that represent different aspects of the browser environment. Here's a brief overview of the differences between them:

? window Object:

* The window object represents the browser window or the global object in a browser environment.
* It is the top-level object and serves as the global scope for JavaScript in a browser.
* Properties and methods attached to the window object are accessible globally. For example, window.alert().
* It contains information about the browser window, such as its size (window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight), location, and other properties.

? screen Object:

* The screen object provides information about the user's screen or monitor.
* It contains properties like screen.width and screen.height, representing the screen's resolution.
* Useful for obtaining information about the user's display, which can be helpful in creating responsive web designs or handling multiple monitors.

? document Object:

* The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser.
* It provides methods and properties to interact with and manipulate the content of the document.
* Examples include selecting elements (document.getElementById(), document.querySelector()), modifying HTML content, handling events, and more.

? In summary:

* window is the top-level object representing the browser window and provides global properties and methods.
* screen provides information about the user's screen or monitor.
* document represents the HTML document and provides methods to interact with its content.
* It's important to note that these objects are part of the browser's Document Object Model (DOM), and their properties and methods are often used in web development to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
